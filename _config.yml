user_description: I'm a Data Scientist, always searching for the next challenge. I achieved a MSc in Statistics at the University of Florence and worked with Florence's CNR and the Department of Statistics of the University of Florence in a project called "machine learning in prostate cancer radiomics". I have also published an article with a team of epidemiolgist on the effects of wood dust on workers. Now I'm working in Sixth Sense.
